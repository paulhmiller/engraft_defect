Paul Miller

This data contains results of culture and in vivo assays on cultured human hematopoietic cells. The paper is about a reduction of neutrophil and platelet outputs from transplanted cells, immediately post-transplant. 

The data is contained in 2 csv files:
- in vitro data
- in vivo data

There are multiple R script files, with one for each set of figures. 

This was built using R version 3.2.3 on Windows 10.
